# 🏎️ Honda vintage car club Webpage

A web project I built with **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf** for a school assignment.  
- It’s a small homepage for a fictional club for people who own older Honda cars — to practice form handling, templates, and multi page navigation in Spring.
- I considered using Spring Security for the admin functions, but I did not have time to completely understand how to use it before deadline. In this version, javascript will set a user Id to a variable in the browser, Java will check if this user Id matches an admin Id on the backend. If successful the admin functions will be implemented in the DOM

**Currently the admin login is:**
- admin
- admin

## 🌐 What the Site Does

The site has **three pages**:

### 🏠 Home Page
- A welcoming front page introducing the club and what it’s about.  
- Just a simple intro for visitors and car enthusiasts.
- From here you can log in, when logged in you will unlock additional functions and the add members page.

### 👥 Members Page
- Shows a list of all current club members.  
- Each member displays:
  - **Name**  
  - **Age**  
  - **What they do for the club**  
  - **What car they have**
  - **Are they a paying member**
- Members can be removed by admin.

### 📝 Add members Page
- A form where the admin can add more members.  
- It asks for:
  - Name  
  - Age
  - Club Role
  - What car they drive  
  - If they have a paid membership 
- When all forms are correctly filled out, the member will be added to the list.
- The input requires all fields to be filled out and that the member is at least 16 years old.

## 🧑‍💻 Author: Jonas Tibbelin
- Created for a school assignment project with Spring Boot & Thymeleaf.
## **My Thoughts**
- This was quite difficult for me at this time, I did have to make use of most (if not all) that I've learned so far.
- I did quite quickly set up the member class and the 3 pages, Displaying the different members with thymeleaf and communicating the user Id's between frontend and backend
  was probably the most difficult parts of the project. When the communication worked, implementing the admin restrictions to different functions was quite easy.
- The design wasn't a big focus but I still ended up spending quite a bit of time on it in the end. I'm learning but I haven't quite perfected my placement of different sections on the screen.
  The login injected by the javascript could look a lot better IMO.
